# linear_regression
In this repository i have attached code of linear regressing both by using machine learning library and without using it.

I have attached three program for linear regression. 
* linear_regression in one variable:- in this i have taken no of data input from user,features and labels then i calculated most suitable slope and equation using formula of linear regression i plotted those points with a st. line which is the output of the linear regression calculation.Along with this i have displayed equation obtained for predicting .

* ml2 and ml3 :- in these code i have used machine learning library for doing prediction on the basis of linear regression.. details are commented in code.
